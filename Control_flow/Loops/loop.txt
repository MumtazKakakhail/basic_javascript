loops are control structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are several types of loops in JavaScript, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop
for loop:
A for loop is a control flow statement in programming that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of times.
While loop:
A while loop is a control flow statement in programming that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
do while loop: 
A do-while loop is a control flow statement in programming that is similar to a while loop, but with one key difference: a do-while loop guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the loop condition
